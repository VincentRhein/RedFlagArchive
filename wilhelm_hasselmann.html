As a member of the predecessor parties of the SPD - the General German Workers. He was a member of the Reichstag between 1874 and 1877 and between 1878 and 1880/81. Due to social revolutionary anarchist ambitions, he was excluded from SAP as a dissident. This exclusion from the party and the repressions against any socialist activity by the Socialist Law prevailing in Germany at the time prompted Hasselmann to emigrate to the USA.<br> <a href="index.html" target="_self"> Back to Red Flag Archive </a></h3>
