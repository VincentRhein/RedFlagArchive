As a political theoretician, Luxemburg developed a humanitarian theory of Marxism, stressing democracy and revolutionary mass action to achieve international socialism. One of her most meaningful works was her book The Accumulation of Capital. The book was first published in 1913 and was the only work being published on economics. It examines what connections exist between capitalism, nationalism, militarism and imperialism.<br> <a href="Index.html" target="_self"> Back to Red Flag Archive </a></h3>
